# UpVote-App

UpVote! focuses on displaying a list of submissions that users can vote on. Each submission will
present some information about itself like an image, title, and description. All submissions are sorted
instantaneously by number of votes. The up-vote icon in each submission will allow users to increase
vote numbers and subsequently rearrange submission layout. Used Vue.JS and HTML5 to complete this app. Very simple app constructed from the "Fullstack Vue" book by Hassan Djirdeh.
